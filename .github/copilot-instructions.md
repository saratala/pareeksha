This project is a minimal React app for video/audio interview simulation. The workflow is:
- Show a question
- Record audio and video feedback
- Send the recording to an LLM (OpenAI/Gemini, vision or non-vision)
- Display the LLM's feedback

Keep code modular, modern, and easy to extend. Use functional components and hooks. Docker support is required.
